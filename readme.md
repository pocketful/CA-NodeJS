# ðŸš€ Getting started

## Configure files

* Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and put your configuration variables in it.
* Database tables are in `db.sql` file. You can look at the file and create each table manually or you can just run the file with MySQL and it will create all the necessary tables automatically.

## Start the project

```
npm install
npm run
```
